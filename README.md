# MavenCycleCompleteSalesDashboard
I have created a dashboard to identify the sales insights for Maven Cycles using business intelligence tool over a period of time. 
I started initially with the data cleaning of sales data obtained from raw CSV file and followed by ETL using Power BI
in order to identify the key sales area and the products that are more profitable for a business to take business decisions
